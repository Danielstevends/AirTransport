# AirTransport Calculator

This repository will calculate operational variables comparing between air taxi vehicle and ground transportation.
We use sliders to determine some variables such as fuels, emission, etc to be customized. 
As input, we use google maps API to find distance and travel time.

Feel free to use this repository and attach my name if you feel this helpful for your project.
